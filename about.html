                            <h2>History</h2>
                            <p>The union road map history of NKA IMA NDITO URUAN (NINU).Uruan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Nnewi Anambra state. Chapter has happened as a drop of water in most universe. When three better head became ONE; That
                                is to say, the father, the son and the holy spirit- they all formed one God (trinity) Ironically the systematically story of history began in the year 1994, sept., 16th. There were three Wise Men Brothers, Mr. Umeh Akpan(Late)
                                a staff of Jimex, Company Mr. Effiong Paulinus a staff Ibeto group of company and Mr Felix Effiong a staff of chartered aluminum company all these stated companies located at nnewi metropolis Anambra State. The above three
                                wise men came from one particular community Ndon Ebom and also same street named Nkime- Nta street. It would sound so funny, to dick up to this point they love themselves despite all hurt of poor salaries received monthly
                                then which is not necessary to disclose it here. .However, the three Wise men summon a symposium conference within themselves and came out with a very revolutionary idea to established a family meeting (union) and to name
                                it after our beloved community Ndon Ebom which vital aims are to foster; Unity, peace, Progress etc. among us living in a strength land. Here a name was suggested “NKA IMA NDITO NDOM EBOM (NINNE)” Nnewi. The three wise
                                men unveiled the said motivated idea to all sons and daughters of the soil. Very few indigenous people bought these three wise men idea while others saw it as a taboo or unimportant to them. Be that as it may, those who
                                understood the significant means of integrated accepted the idea and instance inauguration took place, under listed names below form the First Executed Board of Nka Ima Ndito Ndon Ebom: Mr. Felix Effiong – President/V.
                                President Mr. Effiong Paulinus- Secretary Gen/ Assist. Mr. Umeh Akpan(Late)- Treasurer. Mr. Ephraim Edet- Financial Secretary Mr. Linus Bassey- Assistant Financial Sec. Mr. Ubeh Asugwo – Welfare Officer. Mr. Francis Akpan-
                                Provost Madam Cornelia P. Effiong- Woman Adviser. Engr. Gabriel Essien- Ground Patron Engr. Esu Udoh- Adviser.

                            <p>At this junction the first president of the group goes to one of the three wise men, Mr. Felix Effiong, in his govt. he rules without form of actual tenure of office due to scanty number of memberships, but they see unity,
                                peace and welfare of the members as supreme then. Nka Ima Ndito Ndon Ebom progress for years, membership improved an election was demanded by one third of the general house which was won by the second wise men Mr. Effiong
                                Paulinus, able president turbulently changes the affairs of the union. He formulated some bye-laws, introduces two years single tenure of office, brought in two nearby communities comprises of Ekpene-Ukim and Ituk Mbang
                                to join the union because of nonchalant attitude of claims ownership members he has been stated to experience during his tenure. That was not enough; he called upon the following personalities and honored them with title
                                (fathers) (Ete) in person of Engr. Gabriel Essien as Ete Eberedem Ndito Ndon Ebom; Engr. Esu Udoh – Ete Unwana; Chief Titus Effiong As Ete Ndito Uruan. They all awarded with certificate of recognition to become part and
                                parcel of the union respectively. Still under Mr. Effiong Paulinus administration, union uniform call Ikpok-Ube and cultural; instrument was also been launched which we used it to display N’Ebom cultural dance in every
                                union outing up till date. Having got enough space to states all his legacies, let draw a curtain to accumulate others achievers. In spirit of sportsmanship and fair justice, Late Mr Umeh Akpan trade- mark can’t be easily
                                forgotten being the third wise man; government to reach his hand……, we lose him, such a great philanthropist, a peace maker. May his gentle soul rest in perfect peace. Amen in the year 2005, another election was conducted,
                                Mr. Savour Edet. Carried the day; he did well, he was able to launch the 1st union constitution of Nka Ima Ndito Ndon Ebom in booklet, he also maintain welfare packages of the members. But his dark side was that, he refused
                                to step down as his tenure expired. However the little deed of him, he later remember” Law spare no one” he finally dropped the mantle not to stain his reputation. History count itself here, as union rethink about immense
                                contribution of the third Wiseman late Mr. Umeh Akpan has a saying that goes this way” Owo-isituke aban ikwa afan”. At this point of view, his bosom brother Mr. Vincent Akpan has to won election by vote of confidence to
                                complete the three wise men life cycle without cheat. He experiences a lot of dilemma beyond his control.

                                He further stood there and changed the union name from Nka Ima Ndito ndon Ebom(NINNE) to NKA IMA NDITO URUAN(NINU). At these marvelous and wonderful achievement, so far without questioning by members why? Made him to be
                                joyfully beat chest like the happiest man on earth, of him to laid down such gigantic record as his footprint and left the office peacefully. In these circumstances, under the umbrella of Nka Ima Ndito Uruan, an election

                                handed over to him by a man of integrity, a visionary man, a man of substance, a man wherever he set target he can’t miss it, a man who believe in practical not theory, a man only his compass indicator trace out map of
